test commit

to run the program, type something like: ./algobowl.py input.txt

try running ./algobowl.py piazza_input.txt
it uses 100000 (by default) random swaps of a random element in the highest-time
computer with a random element in a random computer

on piazza, (piazza_input.txt) the highest they get is 9889.1875 and we can get
9889.0 if you run it a couple of times or get lucky
